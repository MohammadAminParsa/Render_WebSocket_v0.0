# ⚡ WebSocket Server for ESP32

A simple and lightweight WebSocket server that receives **voltage** and **status** data from an ESP32 microcontroller and forwards it to connected WebSocket clients in real time. 🔁📡

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project provides a WebSocket server written in Python (or Node.js, depending on your stack) designed to interface with ESP32 devices. The ESP32 sends real-time data — including voltage readings and status flags — to the server. The server then broadcasts this data to all connected WebSocket clients.

Ideal for IoT dashboards, device monitoring, and low-latency communication with microcontrollers.

---

## 🧰 Features

- 🔌 Real-time WebSocket communication
- 📶 Supports multiple simultaneous clients
- ⚙️ Parses and forwards voltage + status data
- 🌐 Easy integration with frontend dashboards or monitoring systems

---

## 📡 How It Works

1. ESP32 device connects to the WebSocket server.
2. It sends data packets containing:
   - 📊 Voltage readings
   - ✅ Status indicators (e.g., connected, error state, etc.)
3. The server receives the packets and:
   - Logs or processes them (optional)
   - Forwards them to all connected clients

---

## 🛠️ Setup

### 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.7+ (or Node.js if applicable)
- `websockets` or similar WebSocket library
- ESP32 device with WebSocket client firmware

### 🧪 Installation (Python Example)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/esp32-websocket-server.git
cd esp32-websocket-server
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🚀 Run the Server

```bash
python server.py
```

Make sure your ESP32 is configured to connect to the correct IP and port.

---

## 🧪 Example ESP32 Payload

The ESP32 should send JSON-formatted messages like:

```json
{
  "voltage": 3.72,
  "status": "OK"
}
```

---

## 🖥️ Example Client Message Handling

Clients can connect via WebSocket and listen for incoming messages:

```javascript
const socket = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8765");

socket.onmessage = function(event) {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log("Voltage:", data.voltage, "Status:", data.status);
};
```

## 🔒 Security

For production use, consider:

- Adding authentication
- Switching to secure WebSockets (`wss://`)
- Validating and sanitizing input
